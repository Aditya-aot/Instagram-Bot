ðŸ¤– Excited to share my latest project: An Automated Instagram Fact-Posting Bot!

I built a Python application that automatically:
- Fetches interesting facts from API-Ninjas
- Renders them onto custom image templates
- Posts them to Instagram with relevant hashtags
- Runs on a schedule (every 6 hours)

Tech stack:
- Python
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation
- Instabot for Instagram API integration
- Requests for API calls
- Text wrapping for clean typography

This project helped me learn about API integration, automation, and social media development. Always looking to connect with others interested in Python automation tools!
